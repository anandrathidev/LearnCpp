Any matrix for which ali ofthe off-diagonal entries are zero is called a diagonal matrix. 
    For example, the matrix  
    3 0 0
    0 8 0
    0 0 8
                            
- The transpose of a matrix M is the matrix denoted by Mt whose rows are equal to the columns of M,
- If a matrix M is equal to its transpose then it is called a symmetric matrix because all of the entries above
  and right of the main diagonal are the same as the entries below and left of the main diagonal, with the row and column indices reversed.
- An n-dimensional vector can be regarded as an n x 1 matrix or as a 1 x n matrix,
and as such, is called a column vector or a row vector.

-In order to implement column-major storage order in a two-dimensional array,
we need to make the first array index the column number and the second array
index the row number.

-The dot product between two n-dimensional vectors a and b is a scalar quantity
    given by the formula    
        a.b = SUM[i=0,n-1](ai*bi)
    The corresponding components of the two vectors are multiplied together and
    summed. This product gets its name from the notation a · b in which a dot is placed
    between the two vectors participating in the product. Because it produces a scalar
     quantity, the dot product is also known as the scalar product. 
     
     3D dot a.b = ax*bx + ay*by + az*bz
     
    If the vectors a and b are regarded as column matrices, then the dot product be
    also be expressed as 
          a.b = a * b'
          
          a[M,1], b[M,1]
          a.b = a[M,1] . b[1,M] = a[1,1] , scalar 
          
    Comparing the definition of the dot product with the formula for vector magnitude
    , we see that the dot product of a vector with itself produces the squared magnitude of that vector. 
    We use the special notation v^2 in place of the dot product v · v or ||v||^2

       Property                     Description
       a·b=b·a                      Commutative law for the dot product.
       a·(b+c)=a·b+a·c              Distributive law for the dot product.

     - a.b = ||a||*||b||cos(Th) where Th is the planar angle between the directions of a and b if they were to be drawn as arrows starting at the same location.
     it provides a computationally cheap way to determine how much two vectors are parallel to each other or perpendicular to each other.
     assuming the magnitudes of a and b remain the same, 
     a . b = Max when Th = 0 when a and b are parallel and point in the same direction. 
     a . b = -Max when Th = 0 when a and b are parallel and point in the opp direction. 
     a . b = 0  Th = 90 a and b are perpendicular, no matter what the magnitudes of a and b are. orthogonal
 
 
-cross product 
    The cross product between two 3D vectors a and b is another 3D vector given by the formula
    axb =(ay bz - axby , axbx -axbx , axby - aybx)·  the z component of the cross product is calculated using the x and y components of the input vectors. 
                                                     subscripts for a and b used in the positive term of each component of the product are the next two
                                                     letters in the sequence x -->y-->z, with wraparound, and the subscripts are simply reversed for the negative term.
     Cross products gives another vector WHICH IS PERPENDICULAR   
     axb = 0 if a, b are parallel , 
     if a and b are paralll , b = ta b is scalar multiple of a 
     so a x ta = 0

    axb = | 0  -az  ay | |bx |  =  |-az*by + ay*bz |   
          | az  0  -ax | |by |     | az*bx - ax*bz |
          |-ay  ax   0 | |bz |     |-ay*bx + ax*by |    

    ||axb|| =  ||a||*||b|| * sinTh

1.6 Vector Projection 
 decomposing a vector into its separate components.
    i = (1,O,O)
    j = (0,1,0)
    k = (0,0,1)
    
    v = vx*i + vy*j + vz*k 
    v = ( v . i)*i +(v . j)*j +(v . k)*k
    Each component of Equation is called the projection of v onto one of the vectors i, j, and k parallel to the
    coordinate axes.
    
    a11b = (a.b / ( (b)^2 )) * b
    The notation a11b indicates the component of the vector a that is parallel to the vector b, and Equation gives us the projection of a onto b.
    a11b = (b.b' / ( (b)^2 )) * a
    The product bb' yields a symmetric matrix that can be multiplied by the vector a to perform the projection.
    The matrix in this equation is an example of an outer product.
    
  rejection:
    If we subtract the projection a11b from the original vector a, then we get the part
    that's perpendicular to the vector b because we've removed everything that is parallel
    to b. The perpendicular part of the decomposition is called the rejection of a
    from b and is written  
    a_|b = a - (a.b/(b^2))*b 
    
    
1.7 Matrix lnversion
        The identity matrix I n is the n x n matrix whose entries on the main diagonal are all ones and whose entries everywhere else are all zeros
        In is called the identity matrix because it has the property that AIn = A
        
        The determinant of an n x n matrix M is a scalar value that can be thought of as a sort of magnitude for M It is written as det (M) or IMI.
        
Property                     Description
det (I n )= 1                Determinant ofthe identity.
det ( A T ) = det (A)        Determinant of a transpose matrix.
det ( A -i ) = 1/ det (A)    Determinant of an inverse matrix.
det ( AB) = det (A) det ( B) Product rule for the determinant.
det ( t A) = tn det (A)      Scalar factorization for the determinant.        

lnverse Calculation 
If it exists, the inverse of a matrix can be found through a process called GaussJordan
elimination in which elementary row operations are successively applied
to the matrix until it is transformed into the identity matrix.
